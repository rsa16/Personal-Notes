## Sub Goals:

None, really. This is a goal within itself.

### Tips To Be Productive
* **Reduce the number of decisions you have to make**
	* This can be accomplished by making decisions ahead of time (i.e. picking clothes the night before, or deciding advance when you will exercise)
	* **OR** you can create habits around doing specific things
* **Finish your day before it starts**
	* Setup a schedule for yourself (in Obsidian, preferably)
	* Leave space for a **OBT** (a single big task that must be done), and write down some **NMWs** (daily habits that should always be done, such as exercising)
	* Obviously leave as many free spaces as you can fit, and write down spaces to take a break
	* The more planning you do, the less you have to think about it and give yourself time to do something else
* **The Nothing Alternative: stop doing something else when you procrastinate**
	* You are not obligated to focus on your OBT, or any tasks you have to do. 
	* However, if you place yourself in the mindset that you have two options: a) to do your OBT, or b) do *nothing* at all, at a point you will eventually bore yourself and start with your task
* **AnimeDoro**
	* Similar to the Pomodoro technique of studying, the animedoro is an ultradian cycle of 120 minutes broke down into 40 minutes of studying and 20 minutes of anime breaks.
	* It's a task-reward system that works surprisingly effective
* **3-2-1**
	* If you are doing something mindless such as scrolling or reading, count down in your head from 3 to 1, and stop.
	* This works, for some reason.
