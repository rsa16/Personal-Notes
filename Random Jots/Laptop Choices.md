* **Dell XPS 14** - light and minimal design, sleek as a macbook pro. 
	* Not too small, 14.5 inches and 16:10 aspect ratio
	* Costs *$1,800*... is baba willing to pay premium for better specs?
	* *Specs* - Intel Core Ultra 7, 16GB LPDDR5 (upgradable), 1 TB M.2. NVMe, Backlit Keyboard, Fingerprint Reader, No Touch Screen (optional), RTX 4050 w/ 6GB VRAM
* **Framework 13** - extremely repairable, smaller design
	* 13 inches, but 3:2 aspect ratio, 50% wider in height
	* Costs *$1,200*, much more budget friendly than the XPS
	* *Specs* - Intel Core i5-1340P or Ryzen 7, 1 TB SSD, 32 GB built-in, Backlit Keyboard and Expandible Ports
* **ASUS Zephyr G14** - better gaming laptop overall, actually a bit of an in-between from Dell XPS (prefered choice)
	* 14 inches, 16:10 aspect, 120Hz, 3K
	* Costs *$1,600*
	* *Specs* - AMD Ryzen 9 8945HS, RTX 4070, No Fingerprint Reader, Bac

### How To Choose
- Choose Starlabs Starbook for the ultimate Linux compatibility - otherwise would not reccomend
- Asus Zephyr G14 (2024) if portability is a MUST, costs a lot extra
- Asus Zephyr G14 (2023) if performance is better, cheaper too but thicker chassis
	- RAM is also upgradable here, on the first one it is not
- Dell XPS 14, wouldn't recommend buying over Zephyr unless 32 GB is a must with slim design
- Framework 13 for ultimate repairability and ability to add to specs
