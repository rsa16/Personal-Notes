I love to get close and personal
So don't get stressed be rational
You think you feelin tactical
But I punch with lyrics, can't have u feelin magical
So come at me, bitch~

Yeah, ay

[monologue]
Look
In the end
Who wanted to do this? Wasn't nobody but you. Not me.
And I already told you this
But I ain't backin down
So take this like a man

Wasn't sure if u gon talk about race
I'm no pussy, that's for sure, and Jaxon's bloodline were slaves, so-
Fuck all of 'em haters who hate
If we went back in time u know 4 sure he'd be in chains

Sum yall dont know what u talkin bout
Bitch I know
You said you would drop my address and the route
But its all for clout

Now you scared that I am callin out
So go and run back to them boots
Got yall shakin like new recruits, yuh

jj like them little kids
he tryna rizz with pics of dick
u even know how small it is
cuz it ain't at all if it don't exist

Japjeev Singh, more like Fuck My Ding!
that's the thing yo you hear him sing
fucking "UwU"-----
