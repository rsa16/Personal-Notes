It is necessary to approach the issue of piracy with a critical lens and recognize that engaging in illegal activities, such as digital intellectual property theft, ultimately undermines the creators and industries that rely on these works. Instead of justifying piracy, it may be constructive to explore alternative models that balance access to digital content with fair compensation for creators.

maybe you can give some examples of these 'excuses' so the audience has some context, and they can quantify the impacts of having the excuses

**To garner further positive attention from both public and government eyes and advocate to solve the roots instead of blocking first-hand, we must also consider digital intellectual property from an ethical standpoint.**

**Simply because the public may eventually see piracy as unethical due to these reasons does not mean that the government will do the same, as they operate in entirely different circumstances and situations.**

**It can now be proven that digital intellectual property theft is—at least within most cases—ethically unacceptable, however, it is only until it can be proven that piracy negatively affects both ethical, social, and economic areas that we can fully endorse a conclusion to halt (or at least slow) the spread of digital property theft.**
