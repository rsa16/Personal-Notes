Sucks ass
### Intro
I don't need this shit, I'm a badass, I'm savage
Fuckin your mom, she a bitch that's kinda average
When her pants drop, she be shaking her ass in
that's kinda weird, not gon lie, i'm no maverick

im not droppin heat, till I wait for an answer
you can drop the addy and some more, this shit cancer
at the same time i'll be with my lap dancer
climbing up my stack of money, all in new hampshire

two glocks, im about to say some
yuh listen to my words, cuz you ain't got none, ay
Veer say he got a bar, i say it ain't done
Gon smack you to the ground, bitch you better run

Fuck the sax, go back and play the drums
How'd u get a solo, you fuck her for fun?
You suck up to her like you like her or sum
But you like all em teachers, don't you son
### Hook Transition In - Intro End

drop em bags
im gon real with you fags

I put a million in this bitch 
At least she like me 
Droppin all em bands in a ditch 
She's go and find it 

I showed her yo face 
She was incited 
Told her you'd give a million to fuck 

But where the bang for the buck
It ain't a man with bad luck
It ain't none of that, you js \suck

She jumped off faster than a truck
