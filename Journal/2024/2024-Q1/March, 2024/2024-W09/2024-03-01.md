Do what though? I don't know. I wrote this when I was showing it to my dad.

## Things I am grateful for:
- Baba
- My computer and Obsidian for making this insanely incredible application.


## Glimpse of the day

**Dear Diary**,

Today was boring. I don't know how else to describe it. We did pretty normal stuff. We didn't do anything special. I am looking forward to my test results on Tuesday however. 

Also, I have to find some ways to make money. I really need money. I need to buy things for myself.

(P.S. I forgot to write the past 2 days, and today is actually 3/5/2024. That's why IDK why I'm writing here. Some gaps. Whoops.)
