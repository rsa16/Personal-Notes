## Things I am grateful for:
- Sleep
- Actually not so much on sleep


## Glimpse of the day

**Dear Diary**,

Today was an Odyssey of the Mind day. The entire evening was focused on memorizing lines. It's pretty clear we won't win on Saturday. Why do all this work? (This is morbidly incorrect, as I have forgotten to write this journal and empty space bothers me. See [[2024-03-09]] to see what happened for OM).

I spent most of the day attempting to write a decent script. Didn't work. Fuck the script I guess? Improv, baby~

Aon is still acting cool with me. Guess she's either over everything I did to me after my apology. I was thinking of yelling at her again for being an annoying bitch about me saying "sorry," but it's all good I guess.

I'm not gonna talk about OM because it scars me. I really, really, *really* want to sleep. 

Can I go sleep now? ....
No? Fuck you.

Wait. Then I would be... fucking myself? Nah, that's gay. Bye bruh.

Peace out, homie.

*Rehan Ali*
