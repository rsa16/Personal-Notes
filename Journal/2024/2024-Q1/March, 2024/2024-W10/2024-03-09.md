## Things I am grateful for:
- Emotions
- Winning
- Those 3 pins I got from OM


## Glimpse of the day

**Dear Diary**,

I have actually been so lucky this year that it's kind of crazy TBH. I got into HTHS. I won first place at OM. I convinced my dad to buy me fake AirPods. I got a free shirt from OM. Like... think about it.

God. Damn. Also, I was freaking out about OM this morning and I think I was highly running on adrenaline during the performance or else I would've been dead tired.

The script also severely needs improvement. I literally forgot my lines halfway through. It literally took me a whole 5 seconds to remember them.

But... enough about that. We got Chinese food after! I probably need to take a dump, seeing as how I've been stuffing my stomach with food for two days straight (see wedding at [[2024-03-08]])

It's actually kind of crazy. And tomorrow is a birthday party. Weirdest week ever. Gonna have a shit ton of stuff to say when I'm back at school.

Enough about me. Let's talk about you. What have you done that effects you positively? But.... wait... doesn't *you* just mean *me*, cuz... I wrote this?

Nah I can't think about that shit. Peace out, homie.

*Rehan Ali*
