## Glimpse of the day

**Dear Diary**,

Ayy, today was lit. Fridays are always lit, but today was *lit* lit. Like, damn. This wedding was actually so whitewashed, and yet it was so fucking fun. Me, Safwan, Azhar, Ayaan, Sadib, and Sayem hung out. Wildest shit ever. I stained Sayem's suit. Was his fault for jumping me though.

Sadib and Sayem were being their usual goofy asses. Made me crack up, so I'm good with it. Also, the food was delicious. This is the real reason weddings exist.

It was a huge place too. Like DAMN! That shit must've cost **AT LEAST** fifty grand, or I smoke weed (which I don't, as you would know, future me).

The dessert was hella fine too. I had two sundaes. I still feel full and its Saturday now (haha forgot to write journal, stfu).

But... I'm sleepy now. SO, let me sleep.

Peace out, homies.
