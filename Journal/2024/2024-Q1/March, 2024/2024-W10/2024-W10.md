## What is worth remembering about this week?
- I got into the #1 STEM school in the entire fucking country (High Tech HS)
- Won 1st place at Regionals for Odyssey of the Mind (2nd time in a row)
	- Got three medals now
- I got a free shirt! From OM.
- Marriage between Oishi and Tuen. Hanging out w/ the boys was peak.

## What am I grateful for this week, and what am I thinking of?
- I am grateful for Allah. He must have guided me to all these things. 
- Year of the Dragon. I don't believe in superstition but I've been pretty lucky this year.
- My parents. I will always be grateful for my parents.

## What did I set to achieve this week?
- I set out to NOT win regionals.
- I also was prepared to be faced with the news of being rejected from the school

## What did I accomplish this week?
- I managed to do enough studying to get into HTHS.
- No hard effort put in and yet we got into OM States. How the fuck?

## What could I have done better? What are my regrets?
- We could have done way better with the structure and script if we had more time for OM.
- I wonder if I gave the right advice to Shiloh and Joy. Am I the one who's being manipulative now?

## What I want to achieve next week?
- Mend relationships between Shiloh and Joy
- Maintain a steady working pace and beating procrastination
- Get decent grades in subjects
