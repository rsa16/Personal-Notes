## Things I am grateful for:
- Nothing, since I forgot to fill in this journal lmfao


## Glimpse of the day

**Dear Diary**,

Uh... I kind of forgot to fill in journal this day. I'll tell y'all what I did on Wednesday though.

So.... I did nothing. Nothing. At. All. Nothing, except everything was done on this terrible day. Odyssey of the mind is a bitch. TBH, I hoped we would actually lose OM so I wouldn't have to actually do this shit anymore, but according to future Rehan that is no longer possible (See Sat.)

Kind of forgot what I did 3 days ago NGL. No beef or anything happened, went to robotics as usual, Chinese teacher was absent... school was pretty boring. Although, we did have our first (actual) tennis day, since the day before was an orientation. It was raining, so we played indoors, but I'm all in all not too bad at tennis.

I still need Anish to teach me how to play.

Peace out, though.
