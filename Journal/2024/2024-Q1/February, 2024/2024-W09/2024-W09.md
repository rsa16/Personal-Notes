<br/>

## What is worth remembering about this week?
- The entire fiasco about Aon. Will teach me not to every... you know what again.
- It was the first time I started worrying about my productivity. Obsidian, obsidian, all week long
- Honestly a pretty normal week other than that

## What am I grateful for this week, and what am I thinking of?
- My friends are always there for me. At least, when I most need them. Especially Joy, who put his own friendships at risk
- Shiloh the woman.

## What did I set to achieve this week?
- I was attempting to mend relationships with Aon. It didn't go very well, but it exposed me to a truth that I had to see at some point.

## What did I accomplish this week?
- Productivity. Obsidian is insanely cool.

## What could I have done better? What are my regrets?
- I regret not being able to mend things with Aon. 
- I could have handled the argument with him more commonly.
- I wish I didn't think of Aon... as a girl.

## What I want to achieve next week?
- Tuesday, I get my MCVSD results. Hopefully I make it.
- I would like to keep the same level of productivity as I did this week.
