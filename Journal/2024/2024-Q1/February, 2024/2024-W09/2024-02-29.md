# `=this.aliases`
Here's a glimpse of my life: shit is still broken with Aon, Shiloh wants to (off???) herself, and I somehow got in trouble for making fun of someone. It was a joke. A *joke*.

## Things I am grateful for:
- My project partner for clutching up
- My dad for not being mad at me (wasn't my fault)
- My friends for always supporting me
- My computer for me to type this out


## Glimpse of the day

**Dear Diary**,

Not gonna write much, since most of the day was pretty uneventful. Went through school, Chinese class was kind of dumb (wow... Aon is pushy), and Aon still seems to hate me. Shiloh is now being extremely morbid about her own life. I fear she may do something really fucking stupid.

In case she does, I'm gonna constantly text her.
