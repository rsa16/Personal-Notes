## Glimpse of the day

**Dear Diary**,

Life is not fucking good right now.

Odyssey of the Mind keeps coming back to haunt me. I honestly want to quit. I wanted us to lose last time, as morbid as that sounds. I love that we won first place... and I would like the same for us again, but I really can't justify the amount of workload being placed on me. 

Fasting, along with all of this is going to drive me insane. I don't know how much longer I can handle this. But I'm a man. I'm not going to say that I don't want to fast. Allah will help me, perhaps.

I am also lacking in sleep. Last night, someone told me to fix my cardiac rhythms (or whatever they're called). How am I expected to do this? As addicted as I am to reading? As procrastinating of a person as I am? But none of that is an excuse, I suppose. I will try. I have to try.

My eyes hurt. My mind is tired. I am not in a peak state of consciousness.

Maybe I should take a nap? And, maybe only then, would my insane ramblings leave me alone. 

...Now that I think of it, I probably should not have worn a sweater during tennis. It only exhausted me further and caused me to sweat without being able to drink water to refill those sweat glands.
